            <p>Washington is a nice place as far as being diverse in it's climates. It's very lush and green on the coast with nice beaches and much plantlife to enjoy. As you travel further 
                east into Washington that changes, you will find the trees and growth changing more coarse and hardy. When get over the range you will find less vegitation, unless near water 
                sources, and things start to become more baren and hot.</p>
